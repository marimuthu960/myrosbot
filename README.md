SLAM (simultaneous localaization and mapping)
Now i have only uploaded gmapping.
Other algorithms will be added soon

Note:
Physical properties of  robot model is not perfect. This might cause some error in values for slam. But if you could replace it with your own model(xacro), slam will work charmingly.

You could use this as a template for gmapping with ROS
